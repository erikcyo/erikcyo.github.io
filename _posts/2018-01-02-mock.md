### What is mock servers?    
Mock Server is simple server that provide dummy data to mock or simulate external dependencies  

### Why should you use mock servers?    
1. Isolation    
    You have everything in your local code base, so everything is self contained and decoupled from external dependencies. Because of this, you have very stable environment to work with.
2. Faster dev loop
    it simply faster, because you are talking to your [localhost](http://127.0.0.1). You doesn't need pinging to the server.
3. Better testing   
    In unit test, we use a lot of mocks. And it is powerfull because you have full control over what are your mocks is giving you. Mock server gives you the ability to write edge cases and E2E tests. 

### Create mock servers
You can create mock servers using [moco stand alone](https://github.com/dreamhead/moco).    
I have learning how to build mock server for my localhost. For the sample code, you can found [here](https://github.com/erikcyo/mock-server), try it  :thumbsup:
