### What is BDD? :confused:   
BDD word phrase origin, come from [Dan North](https://dannorth.net/bio/). He defined, BDD is a second generation, outside-in, pull-based, multiple-stakeholder, multiple-scale, high-automation, agile methodology. It describes a cycle of interactions with well-defined outputs, resulting in the delivery of working, tested software that matters.

### What is Cucumber?  
Cucumber is open source automation testing framework which supports Behavior Driven Development. It lets us define application behavior in plain meaningful English text using a simple grammar defined by a language called **Gherkin**. Cucumber itself is written in Ruby, but it can be used to test code written in Ruby or other languages including but not limited to Java, C# and Python.  

### What is Gherkin?    
Gherkin is a structured language that follows some syntax to describe scenario inside the feature. Gherkin contains a set of keywords which define different premise of the scenario. You can see the sample above
```Gherkin
Feature: Search feature for users

Scenario: User searches will displayed list product   

Given User is on the main page website
When User input search box
Then search page should be updated with the lists of product
```
